# DOM Markdown

![Embedded Image](./sci-fi.avif)

In the year 2473, humanity had long since spread beyond Earth, colonizing planets and moons in distant star systems. Amidst this interstellar expansion, the **ISV Nomad**, a lone exploratory vessel, drifted through the vast void of space, its mission: to investigate the unknown regions at the edge of the Milky Way.

**Captain Elena Vyasa** sat in the command chair, staring out at the endless sea of stars. It had been six months since the Nomad had left the last human outpost, and nothing unusual had happened—until today.

## Syntax Highlighting

Expo Router enables a best-in-class developer experience by carefully automating and innovating in every inch of the stack.

```typescript
// Render to DOM
"use dom";

// Import MDX as React
import Story from "@/components/mdx/story.mdx";

// Export a linkable route
export default function MDX() {
  return <Story />;
}
```

- Seamlessly create native views with markdown.
- Switch between DOM and native with a single line.
- Create files to define fully linkable navigation.
- And share across all platforms!

<p>Wow, this editor has support for links to the whole <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web">world wide web</a>. We tested a lot of URLs and I think you can add *every URL* you want. Isn’t that cool? Let’s try <a href="https://statamic.com/">another one!</a> Yep, seems to work.</p>
<p>By default every link will get a <code>rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"</code> attribute. It’s configurable though.</p>
<p><strong>This is bold.</strong></p>
<p><u>This is underlined though.</u></p>
<p><em>This is italic.</em></p>
<p><s>But that’s striked through.</s></p>
