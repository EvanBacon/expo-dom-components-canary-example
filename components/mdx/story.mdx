# DOM Markdown

![Embedded Image](./sci-fi.jpg)

In the year 2473, humanity had long since spread beyond Earth, colonizing planets and moons in distant star systems. Amidst this interstellar expansion, the **ISV Nomad**, a lone exploratory vessel, drifted through the vast void of space, its mission: to investigate the unknown regions at the edge of the Milky Way.

**Captain Elena Vyasa** sat in the command chair, staring out at the endless sea of stars. It had been six months since the Nomad had left the last human outpost, and nothing unusual had happenedâ€”until today.

## Best-in-Class

Expo Router enables a best-in-class developer experience by carefully automating and innovating in every inch of the stack.

```typescript
// Render to DOM
"use dom";

// Import MDX as React
import Story from "@/components/story.mdx";

// Export a linkable route
export default function MDX() {
  return <Story />;
}
```

- Seamlessly create native views with markdown.
- Switch between DOM and native with a single line.
- Create files to define fully linkable navigation.
- And share across all platforms!

## Run Everywhere

import Three from "@/components/ambient-bulb";

<Three
  style={{
    height: "100px",
  }}
/>

The same codebase can run on the web, iOS, and Android. This enables you to run wherever your users are, with a single codebase.

## Incrementally Native

Expo builds on top of truly native primitives and enables you to drop down to each one incrementally on a component-by-component basis.

import Flow from "@/components/flow/flow";

<Flow style={{ height: "300px", maxHeight: "300px" }} />
