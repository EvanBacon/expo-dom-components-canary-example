# DOM Markdown

![Embedded Image](./sci-fi.jpg)

In the year 2473, humanity had long since spread beyond Earth, colonizing planets and moons in distant star systems. Amidst this interstellar expansion, the **ISV Nomad**, a lone exploratory vessel, drifted through the vast void of space, its mission: to investigate the unknown regions at the edge of the Milky Way.

**Captain Elena Vyasa** sat in the command chair, staring out at the endless sea of stars. It had been six months since the Nomad had left the last human outpost, and nothing unusual had happened—until today.

## Best-in-Class

Expo Router enables a best-in-class developer experience by carefully automating and innovating in every inch of the stack.

```typescript
// Render to DOM
"use dom";

// Import MDX as React
import Story from "@/components/story.mdx";

// Export a linkable route
export default function MDX() {
  return <Story />;
}
```

- Seamlessly create native views with markdown.
- Switch between DOM and native with a single line.
- Create files to define fully linkable navigation.
- And share across all platforms!

## Run Everywhere

import Three from "@/components/ambient-bulb";

<Three
  style={{
    height: "100px",
  }}
/>

The same codebase can run on the web, iOS, and Android. This enables you to run wherever your users are, with a single codebase.

## Incrementally Native

Expo builds on top of truly native primitives and enables you to drop down to each one incrementally on a component-by-component basis.

import Flow from "@/components/flow/flow";

<Flow style={{ height: "300px", maxHeight: "300px" }} />

## Emoji Picker

import data from "@emoji-mart/data";
import Picker from "@emoji-mart/react";

<Picker data={data} />

## Image Cropper

Image cropping with `react-mobile-cropper`.

import Cropper from "@/components/mobile-cropper";

<Cropper
  image={process.env.EXPO_DOM_BASE_URL + "/placeholder-user.jpg"}
  dom={{
    scrollEnabled: false,
    webviewDebuggingEnabled: true,
    style: {
      flex: 1,
    },
  }}
/>

## Rich Text

Image cropping with `react-mobile-cropper`.

import TipTapWrap from "@/components/tiptap-wrap";

<TipTapWrap
  content={`
      <p>With the History extension the Editor will keep track of your changes. And if you think you made a mistake, you can redo your changes. Try it out, change the content and hit the undo button!</p>
<p>And yes, you can also use a keyboard shortcut to undo changes (Control/Cmd Z) or redo changes (Control/Cmd Shift Z).</p>
<p>Wow, this editor has support for links to the whole <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web">world wide web</a>. We tested a lot of URLs and I think you can add *every URL* you want. Isn’t that cool? Let’s try <a href="https://statamic.com/">another one!</a> Yep, seems to work.</p>
<p>By default every link will get a <code>rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"</code> attribute. It’s configurable though.</p>
<p><strong>This is bold.</strong></p>
<p><u>This is underlined though.</u></p>
<p><em>This is italic.</em></p>
<p><s>But that’s striked through.</s></p>
<p><code>This is code.</code></p>
    `}
/>
