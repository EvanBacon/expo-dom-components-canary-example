# Experimental DOM Components with Expo Canary

This project demonstrates how to use experimental [DOM components](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/dom-components/) with Expo canary.

Your best bet is to use dev clients (`npx expo run`), but you can also try running this in Expo Go but YMMV until Expo SDK 52 is released.

This demo has a template UI from:

- [shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/blocks).
- MDX content from [`@bacons/mdx`](https://github.com/EvanBacon/expo-mdx).
- React Three Fiber [demo](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/re-using-gltfs-dix1y?file=%2Fpackage.json%3A10%2C3-10%2C23) from @drcmda.
- An image cropper from `react-mobile-cropper`.
- Emoji picker from `emoji-mart`.
